## Erika's Blog!

Hi! My name is Erika (or Ernie if we're friends) and this is my blog; welcome!

My day thus far have been educational to say the least! I am excited to continue pursuing software development and can feel my brain _pushing_ to understand these new concepts. 


### Favorite Foods

**All mexican cuisine** but more specifically I love carnitas tacos and burritos. I enjoy making fresh salsas and guacamole! I also love italian foods but have recently gone gluten and dairy free which has make partaking in my Italian favorites; such as ravioli and pizza, more challenging.



### Vacation Destinations

My goal is to go to Hawaii _**ASAP**_ I went once as a senior in high school and oh my goodness, it was such a magically experience. My dream vacation is definitely to go to Bora Bora. I've only seen photos but that is paradise if I've ever seen it. I need to see an ocean that color blue/green once day.
